## Why

Because bugzilla is ugly and we want to make a platform that integrates with 
all of the existing solutions like github issues and gitlab, ideally I'd also 
like to have features such that we could replace proprietary systems like JIRA 
and Rally in the enterprise while bringing issue / bug tracking into the
21st century with things like Social Networking logins and centralizing this
very important piece of running an Open Source project.
